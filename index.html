        different PC components work. I hope there will be more practical sessions like this in the future 
        because they make the learning experience more meaningful. I also enjoyed the PPG Industry Talk, 
        which gave us valuable insight into real job roles, required skills, and career paths that we 
        don’t usually hear about in textbooks. More industry sharing sessions like this would be 
        incredibly helpful for students. Overall, this course has strengthened my understanding of 
        how IT professionals play an important role across different industries. It also motivated me 
        to not only focus on building technical skills but to think about how to apply them in 
        real-world contexts so the knowledge becomes truly useful.<br><br>

    <li>SECR1013 - Digital Logic</li><br>
    In this course, I gained a deeper understanding of the essential building blocks behind computer hardware. I learned how binary numbers and logic gates work together to process data. Through tasks involving Boolean algebra and circuit design, I realized how simple logical operations can be combined to form more advanced digital systems.
    This subject strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, especially when designing and testing logic circuits. The hands-on activities helped me clearly see how basic components connect to create functioning hardware. It gave me a solid foundation in understanding how computers operate at a hardware level.
    Additionally, the lab sessions and project work made the learning experience more practical and engaging. I hope that even more lab-based activities or project assignments can be introduced in future classes, as they make it easier for me to visualize and understand complex circuit designs. <br><br>

    <li>SECI1013 - Discrete Structure</li><br>
    Throughout this course, I developed essential mathematical understanding for computer science, including set theory, relations, functions, and graph theory. I discovered how logic, proofs, and combinatorics play important roles in algorithms and data structures. The lessons encouraged me to think more critically and logically, which helped me solve problems more systematically in both programming and system development.
    In my opinion, using more real-world examples and coding-related tasks would make some of the abstract ideas easier to relate to. Overall, I now see how mathematical thinking supports nearly every aspect of computing from database structures to software engineering and I apply these concepts not only in mathematical tasks but also in coding and system design. <br><br>
    
    <li>SECJ1013 - Programming Technique 1</li><br>
    This course taught me how to use C++ to approach problems logically. I learned the value of building algorithms, controlling the flow of a program with conditions and loops, and organizing code effectively using functions. The process of writing and debugging programs trained me to be more patient and detail-oriented.
    I personally think that adding small projects would help students enhance teamwork and programming practice. I felt proud and satisfied whenever a program I wrote ran as intended. By the end of the course, I was able to write programs to handle data, perform operations and solve practical problems. This subject also strengthened my logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, which are essential for my future journey in software development. <br><br>

    <li>ULRS1032 - Intergrity and Anti-Corruption Course</li><br>
    Through this course, I gained a deeper understanding of why ethics, honesty, and integrity matter in personal and working life. I learned how corruption can negatively impact society, economic development, and trust within organizations. By studying real cases and participating in discussions, I became more aware of the laws and initiatives introduced by Malaysia to prevent corruption. In my opinion, using more practical activities such as case studies and role-playing exercises, like the videos we created earlier, would make learning about integrity more meaningful. Overall, this course taught me that true success is not based solely on knowledge or skills, but also on consistently upholding strong moral values and ethical behavior in everything we do. <br><br>
