# E-Portfolio

## Introduction
This ePortfolio is a simple website I created using HTML to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. It serves as an online space where others can learn more about me and my work.

## Summary
I built the ePortfolio by writing clean HTML code to structure the content clearly and make it easy to navigate. The site includes text and links that represent my personal and academic accomplishments. I uploaded the files to GitHub and used GitHub Pages to publish my website online.

## Reflection
Creating my ePortfolio with HTML taught me the basics of building a website. I learned how to structure content using HTML tags and how to upload my site to GitHub Pages. The biggest challenge was making sure my main file was named index.html so the site would load properly. I’m proud that my website works online and shows my skills. This project inspired me to learn more about web design and development.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Make it more interactive
- Add more style so that it is interesting
- Add images
